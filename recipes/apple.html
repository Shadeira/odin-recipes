    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
<li>8 small Granny Smith apples, or as needed</li>
<li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>
<li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
<li>½ cup white sugar</li>
<li>½ cup packed brown sugar</li>
<li>¼ cup water</li>
<li>1 (9 inch) double-crust pie pastry, thawed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>Peel and core apples, then thinly slice. Set aside.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
<li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and stir to form a paste; cook until fragrant, about 1 to 2 minutes. Add both sugars and water; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>
<li>Press one pastry into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie pan. Roll out remaining pastry so it will overhang the pie by about 1/2 inch. Cut pastry into eight 1-inch strips.</li>
<li>Place sliced apples into the bottom crust, forming a slight mound. Lay four pastry strips vertically and evenly spaced over apples, using longer strips in the center </li>
</ol>
